Intractibility
NP problems: Class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. Example: Hamiltonian path (Given a cycle we can check that it contains all vertices in polynomial time)

NP complete: 
Example: Finding a hamiltonian cycle. Hardest of NP. If solved all NPcan be easily solved.
Definition: Problem is in NP and is as difficult as any probleem in NP 

Some examples of NP complete:
Interval Scheduling
Single resource multiple requests
Select a compatible subset of requests that is of maximum size

ALGORITHM: Job Scheduling so that maximum jobs are taken: 
Pseudocode:
Take the job with minimum finish time:

ALGORITHM: 
Weighted interval scheduling
Jobs are given a weight;
Use DP
Recurrence :  OPT = (for i = 1 to i=n)MAX(Weight(i) + OPT(Fx))
Note: Sort first by end times
Fx is the set of all weights with finish times greater than current weight
For all different weights try each weight as a possible first weight and take maximum
Time complexity = O(n*n) {simple} O(n*lgn) {using binary search // binary heap}

Divide and Conquer:

T(n) = aT(n/b) + {work done in merge}


ALGORITHM: Convex Hull
Brute force in O(n3)

Divide and Conquer approach:
Two finger algorithm for merge
TO DO -----------------------
Graham Scan:
TO DO---------------------
ALGORITHM:
Define rank of an element: Rank(x) = number of elements in set that are <= x
Median find: Find the element with rank $ \left \lceil{x}\right \rceil $

Divide and conquer algorithm.
Select an element x and then divide the set into two sets B and C such that all B has all elements which are less than x and C has all element
